Abstract

   The MILE working group has adopted and continues work on
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] as a transfer protocol for security-
   relevant information between network-connected devices.  SACM would
   like to make use of [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] as a transfer mechanism
   for security-relevant information beyond IODEF, and thus requires a
   taxonomy of semantically appropriate topics with contextually
   appropriate capabilities.  This draft seeks to define this taxonomy.

   WORKING GROUP: The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub.
   Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests at
   https://github.com/adammontville/ietf-mandl-sacm-tool-capability-
   language/.  Instructions are on that page as well.

1.  Introduction

   For the defenders supporting and protecting networks, the deluge of
   data, alerts, best practices, notices and regulations can overwhelm
   even the hardiest of us.  Fortunately for the defenders the tools
   they use have evolved in maturity, functionality and
   interoperability.  However, understanding the specific capability of
   the tools and how they help you achieve certain regulations or best
   practices still presents a challenge.  Does a vulnerability
   management platform also count as or contribute to an organization's
   asset inventory?  Does an Active Asset Inventory tool also help the
   enterprise create its list of active ports and services?  Does an
   organization's implementation of open source tools meet the same
   functional capabilities of a commercial tool (and vice versa)?  What
   additional value does [insert new marketing buzzword] provide to
   protecting the organization?

   One way to address these types of questions is through the
   development of a standardized language to describe security tooling
   capability.  We have standardized languages for describing software
   weakness and vulnerability (CWE, CVE), standardized languages to
   describe platforms and software (CPE, SWID) and also some growing
   standardization for understanding attacker methodology and campaigns
   ([RFC7090], [STIX], [ATTACK]).  While the task of standardizing a

   language of tooling capabilities may seem insurmountable, we believe
   we can attach the problem by focusing on what the tools do rather
   than how they do it.  With this approach we could start to whittle
   down the large corpus of tooling descriptions and distill them into a
   more manageable classes of capabilities.

   By having a standardized approach to describing capabilities we could
   theoretically make direct connections between security tooling,
   security requirements and risks.

3.  What Not How

   The key to this puzzle is to distinguish the what from the how, where
   the what is the action or activity that the tool is implementing/
   completing.  For this exercise we referenced the [CISControls] as a
   good starting point to describe the specific capability that is
   required for the sub-control to be implemented.  While going through
   the process a pattern was discovered, many of the sub-controls had a
   relatively consistent structure, with one of a handful of actions
   being applied to different subjects, listed as follows:

   o  Parse: read and interpret different files and data into an
      consistent format

   o  Scan: Examine parts of something to detect specific feature

   o  Store: Write values and data into a queryable format

   o  Block: Prevent a specific event from occurring

   o  Identify: Uniquely represent data points based on a specific
      premise or criteria

   o  Authenticate: Verify something's identity based on a specific
      criteria

   o  Patch: To mend a weakness or vulnerability

   o  Rate: assign a standard or value to something according to a
      particular scale

   o  Verify: Demonstrate the accuracy of assumptions

   o  Log: make a recording of specific events

   o  Set: Turn on a setting or add a value to the system

   o  Encrypt: convert plaintext information into ciphertext to prevent
      unauthorized access

   Below is an example of how these action terms can be used:

   o  Scan the network for live assets,

   o  Scan assets for deviations to baseline,

   o  Scan assets for known malicious file hashes,

   o  Block from the network assets w/o legitimate certificates

   o  Block from executing unapproved applications

   o  Block from connecting unapproved connections.

   In each of the above examples, there is an action and a subject.  The
   subject allows us to understand where the action is being applied and
   within which context.  For example are we scanning the network for
   live assets, or are we scanning for known out-dated software?  The
   problem then becomes, what ultimately describes the subject - a
   subject could be an endpoint, an attribute on an endpoint, software
   installed on an endpoint, and so on.  Ideally a standardized language
   of system subjects would allow for the capturing of relationships
   between subjects (a Filesystem is on a system, a network consists of
   different systems, applications can be distributed across different
   systems).  The relationships would be key to understanding how
   specific capabilities tie back to different elements of the
   environment and how those protections roll up (or don't) in the
   environment.

   We can extend this to include one more piece of information: Scope.
   As much as we'd like to say that a capability could be applied
   universally across a given environment, the reality is that it may
   only be available to certain platforms.  For example, a specific
   action may only be available on domain-joined systems in a Windows
   environment, or to systems with specific software installed.  This
   scope would then help an operator understand the overall coverage of
   her organization's security tools.

   Another way of looking at this is that a security tooling capability
   is a function of an action-subject-scope tuple, or :

   Capabilities = f(Action, Subject, Scope)
