Abstract

   The MILE working group has adopted and continues work on
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] as a transfer protocol for security-
   relevant information between network-connected devices.  SACM would
   like to make use of [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] as a transfer mechanism
   for security-relevant information beyond IODEF, and thus requires a
   taxonomy of semantically appropriate topics with contextually
   appropriate capabilities.  This draft seeks to define this taxonomy.

   WORKING GROUP: The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub.
   Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests at
   https://github.com/adammontville/ietf-mandl-sacm-tool-capability-
   language/.  Instructions are on that page as well.

1.  Introduction

   For the defenders supporting and protecting networks, the deluge of
   data, alerts, best practices, notices and regulations can overwhelm
   even the hardiest of us.  Fortunately for the defenders the tools
   they use have evolved in maturity, functionality and
   interoperability, however, understanding the specific capability of
   the tools and how they help you achieve certain regulations or best
   practices still presents a challenge.  Does your vulnerability
   management platform, also count as your organization's asset
   inventory?  Does your Active Asset Inventory tool also help you
   create your list of active ports and services?  Does your
   implementation of opensource tools meet the same functional
   capabilities of an enterprise grade tool?  What additional value does
   [insert new marketing buzzword] provide to protecting your
   organization?

   One way that we can attempt to address these types of questions is
   through the development of a standardized language to describe
   cybersecurity tooling capability.  We have standardized languages for
   describing software vulnerability (CWE, CVE), standardized languages
   to describe platforms and software (CPE) and also some growing
   standardization for understanding attacker methodology and campaigns
   (STIX, ATT&CK).  While the task may seem insurmountable: there are so

   many tools that address problems in unique different way.  However,
   if the focus is not on HOW the tool functions, but on WHAT the tools
   does, the scope starts to narrow down drastically.  With this
   approach we could start to whittle down the large corpus of tooling
   descriptions and distill them into a more manageable classes of
   capabilities.

   By having a standardized approach to describing capabilities we could
   theoretically make direct connections between security tooling,
   security requirements and risks.

3.  What Not How

   The key to this puzzle is to distinguish the what from the how, where
   the what is the action or activity that the tool is implementing/
   completing.  For this exercise we referenced the [CISControls] as a
   good starting point to describe the specific capability that is
   required for the sub-control to be implemented.  While going through
   the process a pattern was discovered, many of the sub-controls had a
   relatively consistent structure, with one of a handful of actions
   being applied to different subjects, listed as follows:

   o  Parse: read and interpret different files and data into an
      consistent format

   o  Scan: Examine parts of something to detect specific feature

   o  Store: Write values and data into a queryable format

   o  Block: Prevent a specific event from occurring

   o  Identify: Uniquely represent data points based on a specific
      premise or criteria

   o  Authenticate: Verify something's identity based on a specific
      criteria

   o  Patch: To mend a weakness or vulnerability

   o  Rate: assign a standard or value to something according to a
      particular scale

   o  Verify: Demonstrate the accuracy of assumptions

   o  Log: make a recording of specific events

   o  Set: Turn on a setting or add a value to the system

   o  Encrypt: convert plaintext information into ciphertext to prevent
      unauthorized access

   Below is an example of how these action terms can be used:

   o  Scan the network for live assets,

   o  Scan assets for deviations to baseline,

   o  Scan assets for known malicious file hashes,

   o  Block from the network assets w/o legitimate certificates

   o  Block from executing unapproved applications

   o  Block from connecting unapproved connections.

   In these extremely simple examples, we're looking at capabilities
   being described as the relationship between an Action (the what, in
   bold) and the Subject (to what, in orange).  The subject allows us to
   understand where the action is being applied and within which
   context.  For example are we scanning the network for live assets, or
   are we scanning for known out-dated software?  The problem then
   becomes, what ultimately describes the subject.  This is where there
   is a significant gap in my opinion.  Ideally a standardized language
   of system subjects would allow for the capturing of relationships
   between subjects (a Filesystem is on a system, a network consists of
   different systems, applications can be distributed across different
   systems).  The relationships would be key to understanding how
   specific capabilities tie back to different elements of the
   environment and how those protections roll up (or don't) in the
   environment.

   However, in the imperfect world of technology I believe we need to
   introduce one additional piece, the "Scope".  As much as we'd like to
   say that our capability would be applied universally across our
   environment it may only be available to certain platforms, to systems
   that are domain joined, or to systems that have agents installed.
   This scope would then help you understand the overall coverage of
   your organization's security tools.  For the more mathematically
   inclined here is a quasi-mathematical way of looking at:

   Capabilities = f(Action, Subject, Scope)
